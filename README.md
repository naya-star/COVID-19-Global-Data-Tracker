# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Title: COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

### Short Description
This project is an interactive COVID-19 global data tracker that visualizes COVID-19 vaccination data by country. It allows users to filter and view vaccination data using a choropleth map, which shows the percentage of fully vaccinated people per 100 by country. The dashboard is interactive, allowing users to select a specific country and a date range for data analysis.

## Objectives
- **Visualize COVID-19 vaccination data globally** in an interactive way.
- Allow users to select a **country** and **date range** to filter the data.
- Display a **choropleth map** showing the percentage of the population that is fully vaccinated by country.
- Provide insights into COVID-19 vaccination trends across the world.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used for the analysis and dashboard.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Plotly**: A plotting library used for creating interactive visualizations, specifically the choropleth map.
- **Streamlit**: A Python framework for creating interactive web applications, used for building the dashboard.

## How to Run/View the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/naya-star/COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker.git



# Step 2: Install Dependencies
pip install pandas plotly streamlit matplotlib seaborn


Run the Streamlit App
In the project directory, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

streamlit run app.py

Step 4: Interact with the Dashboard
The app will automatically open in your default web browser. You will be able to:

Select a country from the dropdown list.

Choose a date range using a slider.

View a choropleth map of the world showing fully vaccinated people per 100 by country for the selected date range.

Insights and Reflections
Key Insights:

The map shows the varying rates of COVID-19 vaccination across different countries, with some countries having higher vaccination rates than others.

The choropleth map is an effective way to visualize large-scale global trends, and it provides immediate visual feedback based on user inputs.

Reflection:

**Reflection**:
- The project helped me understand how to use Streamlit to create interactive dashboards quickly.

- Using Plotly's choropleth map was insightful, as it allowed for clear, visually appealing geographic data visualization.

- Future plans could include incorporating more data types (e.g., hospitalization or ICU occupancy rates) for a broader understanding of the pandemicâ€™s global impact.
